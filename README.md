# To-Do List App with TypeScript

This is a simple To-Do List web application built using **TypeScript**. The app allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks. The tasks are displayed in a list, with the option to mark them as completed by checking the checkbox next to the task. When a task is completed, its text gets crossed out, and the user can also remove the task from the list.

## Features
- Add tasks to the list.
- Mark tasks as completed by checking the checkbox.
- Remove tasks from the list.
- Task count is dynamically updated in the footer.
- Built with **TypeScript** for better type safety and maintainability.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the app.
- **CSS**: Styling the app.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript used for better development experience and type safety.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive functionality (event listeners for adding and deleting tasks).

## Installation

To get started with the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/ahmed-zaheerx/todo_list

2. navigate to the project directory:
   cd todo_list

3. Install dependencies (if any are required for TypeScript compilation):
   npm install

4. Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:
   tsc

5. Open the index.html file in your browser to view the application.

How It Works
	•	The user can type a task in the input field and click “Add Task” to add it to the list.
	•	Each task will have a checkbox, and when checked, it will cross out the text to indicate completion.
	•	The user can delete any task by clicking the “Delete” button next to it.
	•	The footer will display the number of remaining tasks dynamically, updating as tasks are added or removed.
